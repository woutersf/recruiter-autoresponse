Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to level set around the level of seniority that you're looking for. 

Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to? 

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job.

In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.
Thanks again for reaching out!
 
I look forward to hearing from you.

Frederik
